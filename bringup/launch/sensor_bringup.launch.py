    # NOTE: if running on a new device and you are using any of the NERUAL depth modes in common_stereo.yaml, it will take a while to optimize
    # do not use any NEURAL depth mode at the dynamic events because we have only a limited time per run. 
    # that is unless the model is already optimized for the compute platform on the vehicle so that the camera can start immediately.

    # if you want to change velodyne configs,
    # VLP16-velodyne_driver_node-params.yaml in velodyne_driver/config
    # or 
    # VLP16-velodyne_transform_node-params.yaml in velodyne_pointcloud/config
    # or 
    # default-velodyne_laserscan_node-params.yaml in velodyne_laserscan/config
    # or
    # velodyne-all-nodes-VLP16-launch.py in velodyne/launch (IMPORTANT: make sure to use VLP_hires_db.yaml instead of VLP16_db.yaml in calibration params)

    # NOTE: If this is your first time using the VLP16 on this device, follow the instructions in the link below.
